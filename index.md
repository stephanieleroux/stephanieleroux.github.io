### **PhD, research engineer in numerical modelling and data processing in Earth sciences** 
* I am a research scientist specialising in numerical modelling of the Earth system. My current work focuses on sea-ice and ocean modelling, with particular interest in ensemble and probabilistic approaches, sea ice short-term predictability, and the coupling of sea ice with the atmospheric boundary layer. I also have a previous background in atmospheric modelling. I’m based in Grenoble and co-founded [Datlas](www.datlas.fr), a small research company.
  
* Some recent or on-going projects and technical realisations i'm involved in:
  * Arctic-BLISS: [A project on sea ice predictability and sea-ice-ABL interactions, funded by the Copernicups Marine Service](https://github.com/cmems-arcticbliss)
  * SASIP: [The Scale-Aware Sea ice Project](https://sasip-climate.github.io/)
  * OSTST-IMHOTEP [(github)]([https://sasip-climate.github.io/](https://github.com/imhotep-project/imhotep-project-on-github)
  * H2020-IMMERSE-MEDWEST60: [An ensembles of high-resolution kilometric-scale regional ocean simulations to study short-term predictability of  surface ocean fine scale dynamics based on  (GitHub page here)](https://github.com/ocean-next/MEDWEST60),
  * H2020-EUROSEA: [Design of the Observing System Simulation Experiments with multi-platform in situ data and impact on fine- scale structures (GitHub page here)](https://github.com/ocean-next/EUROSEA),
  * OSTST-IMHOTEP: [IMpacts of freshwater discHarge interannual variability on Ocean heaT-salt contents and rEgional sea level change over the altimetry Period (web page under construction](),
  * CMEMS-GLO-HR: [Learning from large-ensemble ocean simulations to better interpret satellite and in-situ ocean data](./research.md).
