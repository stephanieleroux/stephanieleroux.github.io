### .

### Research background in:
  - Variability of the climate system : ocean and atmosphere numerical modeling and statistical analysis. 
  - Keywords: *Eddy-permitting ocean GCMs, ocean low-frequency intrinsic variability, ensemble simulations, Atmospheric GCMs, tropical variability, convectively coupled equatorial waves, MJO, deep convection, west-african monsoon, teleconnexions.*

### Previous project:
  - I have previously been working as a postdoc on [OCCIPUT](https://meom-group.github.io/projects/occiput/), an ANR-funded project on intrinsic ocean variability in eddy-permitting ocean models via a probabilistic/ensemble simulation
approach (PI: [Thierry Penduff](http://lgge.osug.fr/personnels/Penduff_Thierry), [MEOM group](http://meom-group.github.io/about/), [IGE](http://www.ige-grenoble.fr/)). I have investigated low-frequency intrinsic ocean variability in the OCCIPUT ensemble simulation (50× ocean/sea-ice global 1/4º hindcasts 1960-2015) with a focus on ocean quantities with potential impact on climate variability 
 (AMOC, Heat Content, SST, etc).

  - I am a former undergraduate student of Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon, France (2002-2004) and got my master degree in Earth and Environmental sciences (2006) from ENS Lyon and Uni. J. Fourier, Grenoble, France.
 - I have a **PhD in atmospheric dynamics (2009)** from  LTHE/Uni. J. Fourier, Grenoble, France. 
 - I have then worked as a postdoctoral research assistant at NOAA, Boulder, CO (2010-2011) and at SUNY , Albany, NY (2012) in the United States, then at CNRM/Météo-France, Toulouse, France (2013-2014), and now at MEOM/LGGE, Grenoble, France since march 2015.
 - I also have the french diploma "Agrégation SVT" (2005) for  high-school teaching.
