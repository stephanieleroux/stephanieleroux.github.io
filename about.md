I am a research scientist in **Physical Oceanography**. I am working for **[CNRS](http://www.cnrs.fr/)** in the **[MEOM group](http://lgge.osug.fr/meom/)** at **[LGGE](http://lgge.osug.fr/)** (Grenoble, France). I am involved in the development of **[NEMO](http://www.nemo-ocean.eu/)** ocean model and in the **[DRAKKAR](http://www.drakkar-ocean.eu/)** consortium. I am a member of **[CLIVAR Ocean Model Development pannel](http://www.clivar.org/clivar-panels/omdp)** and a member of **[SWOT Science Team](https://swot.jpl.nasa.gov/science/sdt/)**. 


I am interested in **ocean fine scale processes**, namely oceanic processes of scales < 200km. I am curious about how they can be observed from **space**, how they affect **large-scale ocean circulation and climate** and how they can be represented in **ocean circulation models**. My research is mostly focused on **ocean fine scale processes** at mid and high latitudes and their impact on climate, with a particular focus on the **Southern Ocean**. 

My work involves designing and analysing **realistic ocean model simulations** covering a range of different scales. To this purpose, I use a range of scientific software (mostly **[NEMO](http://www.nemo-ocean.eu/)** ocean model and **[post-processing libraries](https://github.com/lesommer/oocgcm)** in python). 
Because I believe **scientific software** play an essential role in transforming raw data and ideas into scientific results, I try to contribute to the **sustainable development** of scientific software.

I am excited about the transition towards more **scientific reproducibility** in all the fields of modern science. 
I think **Python** and the **Scipy ecosystem** (Jupyter notebooks, numpy, scipy...) together with version control and **[sofware hosting facilities](http://blog.jupyter.org/2015/05/07/rendering-notebooks-on-github/)** provides a great 
fundation for this **[transition](http://www.nature.com/news/interactive-notebooks-sharing-the-code-1.16261)**.

I agree with the **reproducibility PI manifesto** by [Lorena Barba](http://lorenabarba.com/gallery/reproducibility-pi-manifesto/). I endorse the **[science code manifesto](http://sciencecodemanifesto.org/)**. I am a member of **[NumFOCUS](http://www.numfocus.org/)** (open code =  better science).
