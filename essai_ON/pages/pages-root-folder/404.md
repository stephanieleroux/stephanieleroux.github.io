### We are currently working on our new website. We will be back soon!

We are a team of scientists and research engineers contributing to fundamental and applied research projects on the oceans and inland waters. Our company Ocean Next was founded in 2017 on the initiative of Jacques Verron, oceanographer and expert in data assimilation for  operational oceanography.
