## Jacques Verron
### CEO and founder
Jacques Verron is an emeritus senior scientist at CNRS, expert in numerical ocean modeling, data assimilation and spatial observation, with a particularly strong commitment in the field of spatial altimetry.
Jacques is one of the pioneers of French operational oceanography. As such, in the 90s, he led the first French national research project fully dedicated to operational oceanography. He was strongly involved in the creation of Mercator Océan which has rapidly emerged as the leading european company in the field of operational oceanography and is now entrusted by the European Commission to implement and operate the Copernicus Marine Service. Before committing himself to Ocean Next, Jacques has dedicated his career to research and has supervised more than 60 PhD students and postdocs. He has been editor for various international scientific journals and has authored many scientific publications. He has been awarded the silver medal by CNRS (French government research agency) in 1994, and the first prize from French Ministry of Defense in 1999. He has been, and still is, involved in the management of  various national (CNRS, IRD, CNES) and international (NASA, ISRO, ...) projects.

## Stephanie Leroux
### Research scientist
Stephanie Leroux, PhD, is currently in charge of the activities related to ensemble approaches in ocean numerical modeling and data analysis.
She has a background in Geophysics, Earth and Environmental sciences from Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon and from Université de Grenoble, France. She graduated in 2009 with a PhD in atmospheric dynamics from Université de Grenoble, France. 
Before joining Ocean Next in july 2017, she has been working as a postdoc and a research assistant in various research institutes, including three years in the USA, at NOAA, Colorado, and SUNY, New York, and four years in France at CNRM/Météo-France, Toulouse, and MEOM/IGE, Grenoble.
Her research experience covers a wide range of topics in ocean, atmosphere and climate sciences, including eddy-permitting ocean GCMs and ensemble simulations, ocean low-frequency intrinsic variability, atmospheric GCMs and atmospheric tropical variability, monsoon, teleconnexions.
She gained a strong technical expertise in designing and running ocean and atmosphere numerical experiments with Ocean and Atmospheric General Circulation Models (GCMs) of different types, e.g. full-physics, idealized, data-driven; in developing appropriate numerical tools and metrics;  and in performing statistical analyses on numerical model outputs and observational datasets.


## Laurent Brodeau
### Research scientist
Laurent Brodeau, PhD, is currently in charge of the activities related to high-resolution modeling of the ocean, High Performance Computing issues, coupling of GCM components, and model configurations.
Laurent is an expert in GCM (General Circulation Model) modeling on supercomputers, air-sea interactions, the forcing function of ocean GCMs, inter-coupling of GCM components, ocean-atmosphere coupling, and spatial interpolation of geophysical data. Throughout his career, he has gained a strong expertise with NEMO, the european ocean model, which is one of the fundamental tool on which Ocean Next relies for its activity. He has been contributing to the development of NEMO for a decade and has been part of the NEMO developper Committee since 2014.
Prior to joining Ocean Next in September 2017, Laurent has been employed one year as a Senior Scientist at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC) in Barcelona, Spain. There, his main achievement has been to develop and make the ultrahigh horizontal resolution (~15 km) version of the EC-Earth global climate model (NEMO-ORCA12 coupled to IFS-T1279) come to life in the context of PRIMAVERA WP4. During this year spent at the BSC he gained strong expertise in handling considerably large and complex numerical models, surrounded by leading HPC computer scientists.


## Léa Lasson
### Research engineer
Léa Lasson, engineer, is currently in charge of the activities related to the spatial hydrology in the project context VOLODIA. This project aims to define, validate and promote by their scientific use new methods of spatial data processing for hydrology (altimetry data and imagery). The objective is
to work on the altimetry measurements conversion into water levels and water flow on a global scale.
She is graduated from the science university of Montpellier in fundamental physics, and has a master in Spatial technique and instrumentation from the university Paul Sabatier of Toulouse, obtained in September 2017. During this last year of study, she performed her last year internship at the CNES on data processing and instrumentation for spatial hydrology. 
Before joining Ocean Next in April 2018, she acquired during her years of study, different scientific and technical skills in physics and more particularly in the spatial field. Then, she began to work at the end of her studies at LEGOS (Laboratoire d'Etudes en Géophysique et Océanographie Spatiales)
on the preparation of different tools useful to the project VOLODIA.
Her young engineering experience in the field cover the altimetry data analysis and processing applied to the hydrology. She has developed tools which aim is to validate the data for the rest of the project. As well, she's involved in the elaboration, update and validation of hydrological targets
database which are used by space agencies to improve the behavior of radar altimeters on them continental waters.
